    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This fudgy chocolate cake is so decadent, it has gained the nickname “The Matilda Cake” because it looks just like the cake eaten by Bruce 
        Bogtrotter in the movie Matilda. And I’ll take that as a compliment! This cake really is the chocolate cake of my dreams.

        Cocoa powder is an important ingredient in many baked goods and can affect the flavor and texture of the final product. It is important to use the
        type of cocoa powder specified in a recipe, as using the wrong type can alter the balance of flavors and sweetness. There are several types of 
        cocoa powder available, each with its own distinct flavor and properties.

    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <h3>The Most Amazing Chocolate Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <!-- Step One -->
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to <storng>350°F (176°C)</storng>. Lightly grease three 9-inch cake rounds or dust with flour or cocoa powder. 
            Alternatively, you can lightly grease the pans and line them with parchment paper.
        </li>


        <!-- Step Two -->
        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to combine<strong> 3 cups all-purpose flour, 3 cups granulated sugar, 
            1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon baking soda, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</strong>, and 1 1/2 
            teaspoons salt on low speed until combined.
        </li>

        <!-- Step Three -->
        <li>
            Add <strong>large eggs, 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, </strong> and <strong>2 teaspoons 
            vanilla extract.</strong> Beat on a low speed until smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber
            spatula to ensure everything is mixed in.
        </li>

        <!-- Step Four -->
        <li>
            Divide the batter evenly among the three prepared pans, about 3 cups per pan. Tap the cake pans gently on the
             counter to allow any bubbles to rise to the top and escape.

        </li>

        <li>
            Bake for 30-35 minutes in a <strong>350°F (176°C)</strong> oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
        </li>

        <li>
            Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Chocolate Cream Cheeese Buttercream Frosting</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat together <strong> 1/2 cups butter </strong>and <strong>8 ounces cream cheese</strong> until
             fluffy, about 3 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add 1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder and 3 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat until just combined, about 30 seconds.
        </li>

        <li>
            Beat in 7 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add 1/4 cup milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more once refrigerated.
        </li>

        <li>
            Use the frosting to frost and assemble the cake or transfer it to a piping bag for decorating. Once frosted, the cake should be refrigerated, but it can remain at room temperature for up to 4 hours.
        </li>
    </ol>
